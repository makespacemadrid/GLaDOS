# Makersite

The purpose of this project is to refactor the current wordpress based makerspace site to a modern alternative.

We are considering the following options:
- Static site generator for some content management.
    + ~~Astro~~ Too buggy to be used in production.
    + Hugo

- Single page website.
    + Handcrafted
        * The simpler the better!

**Existing Requirements**
- Represent the corporate identity of the asociation.
- A system to manage and communicate events.
